## Project Description

The goal of this project is to make an e-commerce platform that emulates an armory selling different weapons and armors to inter-planetary travellers, each with their own needs. Each item can be combined with attachments/modifiers (FIRE, EARTH, and WATER) for maximum customer satisfaction. Some travellers will fight off different horrors on different planets, and each one has their own strengths and weaknesses.
